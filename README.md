# Prog1Lab4
This repository contains the different parts for lab4.
I honestly had a bit of trouble with this lab (the beyond-the-textbook questions);
1-For the palindrome, I was able to solve how to determine if a WORD is a palindrome very easily, but I found it very difficult to understand how to do it for sentences (by ignoring punctuation and spaces), so I had to ask for help, but I am still unsure, and feel like there is a simpler way to do it.
2-For the email address, I was able to do it reasonably more quickly, and it works fine, except that the program printed out single statements multiple times for a reason I do not understand. I also wonder if there was a simpler way to do this program as well.
3-I didn't really have any problems with the random generator.
I will do more textbook questions over the next few days to get more practice in, because I did struggle a bit more for this lab.
